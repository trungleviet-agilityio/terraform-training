# Core Configuration
# ===================
# These variables can be set via:
#   1. TF_VAR_* environment variables (recommended for local development)
#   2. AWS Secrets Manager (/practice/{env}/terraform-vars-30_app) for CI/CD
#   3. This terraform.tfvars file (local development only, gitignored)
#
# Variables have defaults in variables.tf. Override them here or via environment variables.
# For local development, copy this file to terraform.tfvars and set your values.

# Uncomment and set your values, or use TF_VAR_* environment variables:
# aws_region   = "your-aws-region"      # e.g., "ap-southeast-1" (or set TF_VAR_aws_region)
# project_name = "your-project-name"    # e.g., "tt-practice" (or set TF_VAR_project_name)
# environment  = "your-environment"     # e.g., "dev", "stage", "prod" (or set TF_VAR_environment)

# Optional: Deployment mode for Lambda functions
# Can be set via TF_VAR_deploy_mode environment variable
# Options: "zip" (default) or "container"
# Uncomment to override:
# deploy_mode = "zip"

# Optional: EventBridge Schedule Expression
# Can be set via TF_VAR_eventbridge_schedule_expression environment variable
# Examples:
#   - "rate(5 minutes)"  - Every 5 minutes
#   - "rate(1 hour)"     - Every hour
#   - "cron(0 12 * * ? *)" - Daily at 12:00 PM UTC
#   - "" (empty) - Skip EventBridge schedule creation
# Uncomment to override:
# eventbridge_schedule_expression = "rate(5 minutes)"

# Backend Configuration
# =====================
# The backend configuration is managed via backend.tfvars file.
# 
# Initialization:
#   1. Copy backend.tfvars.example to backend.tfvars (if needed)
#   2. Update bucket name in backend.tfvars with your AWS account ID
#   3. Initialize with: terraform init -backend-config=backend.tfvars
#
# The backend.tfvars file contains environment-specific backend configuration:
#   - bucket: S3 bucket name for state storage (environment-specific)
#   - Other backend config (key, region, encrypt, dynamodb_table) is in providers.tf
#
# Note: The bucket name pattern is: tt-practice-tf-state-{environment}-{account-id}
#       Replace {account-id} with your AWS account ID

# Remote State Dependencies
# ==========================
# SQS queue ARN is automatically retrieved from 20_infra layer remote state
# Make sure 20_infra layer is deployed before deploying 30_app layer
#
# The remote state bucket name should match the one configured in backend.tfvars
# for consistency across layers in the same environment
