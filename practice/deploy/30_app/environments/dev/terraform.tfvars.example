# Core Configuration
aws_region   = "ap-southeast-1"
project_name = "tt-practice"
environment  = "dev"

# Optional: Deployment mode for Lambda functions
# deploy_mode = "zip"  # Options: "zip" (default) or "container"

# Backend Configuration
# =====================
# The backend configuration is managed via backend.tfvars file.
# 
# Initialization:
#   1. Copy backend.tfvars.example to backend.tfvars (if needed)
#   2. Update bucket name in backend.tfvars with your AWS account ID
#   3. Initialize with: terraform init -backend-config=backend.tfvars
#
# The backend.tfvars file contains environment-specific backend configuration:
#   - bucket: S3 bucket name for state storage (environment-specific)
#   - Other backend config (key, region, encrypt, dynamodb_table) is in providers.tf
#
# Note: The bucket name pattern is: tt-practice-tf-state-{environment}-{account-id}
#       Replace {account-id} with your AWS account ID

# Remote State Dependencies
# ==========================
# SQS queue ARN is automatically retrieved from 20_infra layer remote state
# Make sure 20_infra layer is deployed before deploying 30_app layer
#
# The remote state bucket name should match the one configured in backend.tfvars
# for consistency across layers in the same environment
